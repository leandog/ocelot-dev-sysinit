ocelot-dev-sysinit
==================

Some initial configuration for new Ocelot Team Members and other folks that want a functional Ruby dev environment on their Mac OS X Lion or higher system.


To install, type this into a terminal session:

bash <(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/leandog/ocelot-dev-sysinit/master/install.sh)


If you don't want to wait for the script to tell you, you'll want to go into the Apple App Store online and download/install Xcode 4.3 or higher. This will take a while to download and you'll also need to install the Commandline Tools from within Xcode (Preferences -> Downloads -> press Install button next to Command Line Tools)
